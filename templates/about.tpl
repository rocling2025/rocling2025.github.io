            <h2>About the Conference</h2>
			<p>The 37th Conference on Computational Linguistics and Speech Processing (ROCLING 2025) is the annual conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing (ACLCLP). 
It is a renowned international conference in the fields of natural language processing and speech processing, held annually. With a long history of thirty-five sessions, its research themes encompass various issues and related applications in natural language and speech signal processing. 
This year's conference will be hosted by Academia Sinica. 
The conference will feature keynote speeches by invited experts and scholars, as well as contributions from academia and industry, which will undergo a rigorous peer review process. 
High-quality papers will be presented, and there will also be a presentation of research project results funded by the National Science Council. 
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have realized the capabilities of fluent dialogue, responsive interactions, and question comprehension in artificial intelligence, garnering widespread public interest and attention in the development of natural language and speech processing. 
This year's ROCLING conference anticipates that experts, scholars, and technical personnel interested in natural language and speech will explore the depth and breadth of research and applications in computational linguistics.</p>
